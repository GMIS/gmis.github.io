<p>After research and develop for 12 years, we have got a GMIS prototype. It allows ordinary users to program in quasi nature language to control any intelligent hardware platform such as computers, cell phones, intelligence appliances, smart cars and various kinds of industrial machineries or military equipments etc.</p>

<p>Notice, quasi nature language here means that GMIS just need to learn the words that match their abilities. This is easy to understand: if a robot doesn’t have hands, then there’s no meaning for you to teach it the word “hand”. Meanwhile, at the present stage, the grammar GMIS can understand is just the simplest subject-predicate phrase and its combinations.
</p>

<p>The prototype has following features：</p>
<ul>

<li><h5>Customizable instincts</h5></li>
<p>Under a uniform technology standard, it can customize different instincts for different hardware to get different robot species.</p>


<li><h5>Driven by quasi nature language</h5></li>
<p>With quasi nature language Final C, users from different countries can drive GMIS robots by their mother tongue.</p>

<li><h5>Study and memory</h5></li>
<p>Besides instincts, users can teach the robots more behaviors by themselves.</p>

<li><h5>Execute logic in a way quite like human neural tree</h5></li>
<p>This is the key for robot to realize autonomous intelligence in the future. GMIS is the first technical proposal that can execute tasks in this way.</p>

<li><h5>Logic retrievev</h5></li>
<p>It allows robots continue the unfinished task in any situations.</p>

<li><h5>Change logic in runtime</h5></li>
That means robots can react to current scene dynamically, instead of must be execute by the program.</p>

<li><h5>Use exterior objects</h5></li>
<p>At present, exterior objects refer in particular to existing pieces of executable program in current IT world. That means GMIS can perfectly inherit the programming fruits of current IT world.</p>

<li><h5>Parallel execution ability in natural</h5></li>
<p>It’s a basic ability for human brain to deal with parallel tasks. We often say, “finish A and B at the same time and then C”, which means using parallel and series to realize cooperative computing. Now GMIS can achieve this easily.</p>

<li><h5>Cooperate with other robots</h5></li>
<p>Robots that based on GMIS can interconnect and interwork, cooperate with each other, form joint logics to fulfill any complicated tasks. This will prompt the productivity enormously and makes GMIS becomes the only technology standard for the future internet of things.</p>

</ul>

<p>Actually, you can regard GMIS as next-generation operating system and it will finally cover the existing kind and make it become a basement system.

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h4>1 1.	Why we can’t see intelligence like Siri of Apple on GMIS?</h4>
<p>GMIS is not a chatting robot and it designed to break the dilemma of artificial intelligence field in logical behavior level. We all know that language serves for the expression of logical behavior. Without theoretical breakthrough, the existing intelligent voice assists abandon logical behaviors and go after intelligence in speech recognition, which only makes language become a word game.</p>

<p>Saying from professional angle, without logic, artificial intelligence will never have the complete ability to judge different meanings and resolve conflicts, and have no chance to develop a real intelligence. </p>

<p>Just like the development of human language, GMIS will improve its language ability to fit its logical behavior ability and gives users a real intelligent experience in practical level. Without this ability, the existing so-called intelligence behaviors are a kind of entertainment for publics and have no help on the practicality research of robot.</p>

<h4>2.	Is Final C a new Scripting language?</h4>
<p>Briefly answer: yes. Because natural language is actually a kind of script and different from other scripting language, it’s not another language designed for professional programmers to improve their work efficiency, it’s designed for the compatibility to natural language while control robots by programming. For instance, you can’t read other programming languages to other persons, let alone to robots, however GMIS can. So that ordinary people is able to order robots to satisfy their personalized demands, thus robots will enter into home and realize practical use.</p>

<h4>3.	Why could GMIS finally realize robot’s autonomous intelligence?</h4>
<p>There’re still many difficulties to realize robot’s autonomous intelligence. So far, the prototype of GMIS has already demonstrated how to execute orders in the mode of logical tree and how to build and memorize logical tree dramatically. Just like human brain, GMIS will realize autonomous intelligence by rebuilding the logical tree. We think it’s the most reasonable solution for philosophy consideration and you can hard find another description as simple and elegant as this one.</p>

<h4>4.	What is the relationship between GMIS and the existing operating system?</h4>
<p>Despite at present GMIS is base on windows, but theoretically, it’s able to run in any other operating systems. It will treat this system as a robot, and as its brain, GMIS works to process the inputted information and output functional logic (behavior logic). At present, we need to install the application in operating system to achieve its function, which means that users’ demands will be more and more refined, thus we need to cost more and more time to find a specified APP (there’re already millions of APP in mobile application store). It will be terrible if this situation continues. However GMIS comes, it will release the operating system back to the invisible bottom layer to manage the hardware. Ordinary people just need to speak out their demands, and GMIS will program automatically by logic to assemble the function for the user, and they no longer need to install any applications at all. GMIS is actually the next-generation operating system. </p>
