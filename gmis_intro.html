<p>Unlike existing operating system, GMIS no longer manages hardware but focused on intelligent of logical behavior of device. It decreased the granularity of computer’s behavior (execution unit) from application level to function level so that the task logic can be compiled in real-time on demand.
</p>

<p>On this basis, we have implemented that using a quasi-natural language to drive GMIS, which means an ordinary user will get freedom to control the robot’s behaviors in real time. We wil just need to talk like with Siri, and GMIS will work like a programmer to execute.
</p>

<p>
The more crucial is that all GMIS' behaviors can be assembled into a logic tree to perform. In this way we can easily implement dynamic restructure of logic, memory, learning, prediction, division of labour and so on， which are extremely important features for achieving strong AI. We are confident that there is no other alternative solution.
</p>

<p>
To verify the theory, we have made a prototype and we believe we have got what we wanted.
</p>

<p>
Through GMIS, we can turn any device based on a modern operating system into robot, including but not limited: computer, mobile, home appliance, car, aircraft, various kinds of industrial equipment and military equipment, etc. Robot era will be more within reach of ordinary users.
</p>

<p>The prototype has following features：</p>
<ul>

<li><h5>Customizable instinct</h5></li>
<p>
Under a unified technology standard, we can customize different instincts for different hardware platform to get different robot species.
</p>

<li><h5>Using quasi natural language driven </h5></li>
<p>
By using quasi nature language that named Final C, the difference countries users can drive GMIS-based robots with their own mother tongue.
</p>

<li><h5>Executing task based on logic tree</h5></li>
<p>
Logic tree has an important feature: no matters how to combine, add, and delete its branches, it is still a logic tree, which means robots are able to deal with real-time dynamic scenes rather than rigid working.
</p>
<p>
This is the key for robot to realize autonomous intelligence in the future. GMIS is the first technical proposal that can execute tasks in this way.
</p>

<li><h5>All logic behavior can be memorized and forecasted</h5></li>
<p>
A logic tree can be easily memorized and forecast, it would help understand the natural language with logic context. After memorized a certain amount of logics, GMIS can easily figure out your real means, fundamentally solve the word ambiguity, and forecast the next action, which will laid the foundation for autonomous intelligence. 
</p>

<li><h5>Logic reentrant</h5></li>
<p>
It allows robots continue the unfinished task in any situations,even after many years, without occupying system resources.
</p>

<li><h5>Use exterior objects</h5></li>
<p>
At present, exterior objects refer in particular to existing pieces of executable program in current IT world. That means GMIS can perfectly inherit the programming fruits of current IT world.
</p>

<li><h5>Inborn parallel execution</h5></li>
<p>
GMIS's parallel execution just like working in a parallel circuit, it gives GMIS inborn ability to execute in parallel.We just need to say: "do something A and do something B” that can build a parallel task. It will substantially lower the threshold for the use of parallel computing.
</p>

<li><h5>Cooperate with other robots</h5></li>
<p>
Robots that based on GMIS can interconnect and interwork, cooperate with each other, form joint logics to fulfill any complicated tasks. This will prompt the productivity enormously and makes GMIS becomes the only technology standard for the future internet of things.
</p>


</ul>

<p>Actually, you can regard GMIS as next-generation operating system and it will finally cover the existing kind and make it become a basement system.
</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h4>Why we can’t see the intelligence like Siri of Apple on GMIS?</h4>
<p>GMIS is not a chatting robot and it designed to achieve the intelligent in logical behavior level. We all know that language serves for the expression of logical behavior. Without theoretical breakthrough, the existing intelligent voice assists abandon logical behaviors and go after intelligence in speech recognition, which only makes language become a word game.</p>


<p>Saying from professional angle, without the logic context, artificial intelligence will never have the complete ability to judge different meanings and resolve conflicts, and have no chance to develop a real intelligence. </p>

<p>Just like the development of human language, GMIS will improve its language ability to fit its logical behavior ability and gives users a real intelligent experience in practical level. Without the logical behavior as basis, the existing so-called intelligence behaviors are a kind of entertainment for publics and have no help on the practicality research of robot.</p>


<h4>What is the "quasi natural language driven"?</h4>
<p>The so-called quasi natural language refers to a most small subset of natural language, its syntax is as simple as possible but its use and form should be as much as possible to maintain consistency relative to normal natural language. We called it Final C, namely the final c program language. It is a sort of intermediate language between traditional high-level programming language and natural language. In our view, GMIS will have the ability to complete the transition in future. As a prototype, it can only achieve this in first step.
</p>
<p>
Using this language,we can express any logic formed by subject-predicate-object clause. One of obvious benefits it bring us is that it is possible to directly control robots doing some logical task by voice in real-time rather than by keyboard or mouse (You may haven’t noticed, even the program written by most advanced scripting language is also hard to read aloud).
</p>

<h4>Why could GMIS finally realize robot’s autonomous intelligence?</h4>
<p>This is a very ambitious project, we could only say obtain some necessary prerequisites to achieve autonomous Intelligent.The prototype of GMIS has already demonstrated how to execute orders in the mode of logical tree and how to build and memorize logical tree dramatically and so on. We think it’s the most reasonable solution for philosophy consideration and you can hard find another description as simple and elegant as this one.</p>

<h4>What is the relationship between GMIS and the existing operating system?</h4>
<p>Because GMIS no longer manages any hardwares, that means it must be running on the existing operating system and believed the system is a robot. As the brain. GMIS takes charge of processing the inputted information and outputting functional logic (behavior logic). At present, we need to install the application in operating system to achieve its function, with users' demands more segmenting, we need to cost more and more time to find a specified APP (there’re already millions of APP in mobile application store). It will be terrible if this situation continues. However GMIS comes, it will release the operating system back to the invisible bottom layer to manage the hardware. Ordinary people just need to speak out their demands, and GMIS will program automatically by logic to assemble the function for the user, and they no longer need to install any applications at all. GMIS is actually the next-generation operating system.</p>
