<p>
GMIS open its sources under GPL terms, which means that the SC of GMIS is freely accessible to the users. It is in the public interest for us to open source and it will helps GMIS becomes the only technology standard of the whole world and avoids such split between windows and linux in next-generation operating system.
</p>

<p>
However, GMIS doesn’t give up its business value. We can provide other services to get commercial returns, such as customize robot brain for specified hardware platform. Actually, GMIS has a broad market, we don’t need to worry about its business model.
</p>

<p>
In some situations, some customers may ask us to close source for their customized products, which means that GMIS must use dual-license. The precondition for using dual-license on the base of GPL is the agreement of all the contributors.</p>

<p>
So if you are planning to contribute your code to GMIS, you must accept all the commercial arrangement GMIS makes. However, it’s not a bad thing for you because we will regard your contributions to GMIS as a kind of crow funding behavior and you have the right to get the rewards according to your contributions (contact us to get more details).</p>

<p>
Any contributions, including funding or technical services (such as development work or legal work), from any persons are all welcomed.</p>
