<p>
For developing GMIS from prototype to the general robot brain with autonomous Intelligent，except the key technology breakthroughs, it also need integrate the existed research results of various technical branch. Following the enormous workload and intellectual property rights barrier, which determines that it is not a traditional private organization or company will be able to finish thing.
</p>

<p>
We need a new development mode, it must be open enough to accommodate other people to join at the same time, it must comply with the commercial law in order to provide adequate incentives.
</p>

<p>
To this end, we plan to introduce an unprecedented crowd developing mode to push GMIS forward.
</p>

<p>
To put it simply, we always encourage anyone in any time to participate the development of GMIS, all of the contributions for GMIS  will be converted into the shares to repay the participators in which we will elect the board of Directors in charge of all matters of GMIS. Here the "contribution" including but is not limited to: programming, funding, patents, and other GMIS needed services, and so on.
</p>

<p>
Although, GMIS has opened the sources code (now tentatively used the GPL License), but it does not preclude us from realizing the business value of GMIS. Open source is in the public interest and will help GMIS become the global unified technical standards to avoid making the division such as  Windows and Linux operating Systems in the next generation operating system. Through completely owned the intellectual property, we can provide flexible licenses for specific business projects to gain business rewards, such as customizing robot brain for user specified platform and application purpose , etc.

</p>

<p>
Therefore, in order to avoid later problems, from now on, if you intend to submit your code or provide other services to GMIS, it means to join our crowd developing plan, and agree all commercial arrangements that we may make in the future, you will be entitled to obtain the appropriate rights acorrding to the contribution （the specific rules will be decided later ). We welcome anyone to contribute to GMIS.  

</p>

<p>
This is just a preliminary idea, more details could refer to:<a href="new_financing_model.html">New Public Financing Mode in Modern Conditions
</a>. We want more people to participate in the discussion, in order to determine the final rule.
</p>

<p>
There’re recent development  <a href="gmis_todo.html">goals (Todo List)</a> of GMIS .
