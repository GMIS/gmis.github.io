<h2 id="The dilemma for traditional financing">The dilemma for traditional financing</h2>

<p>
Private financing is so easy to be affected by personal emotional factors, just put it away. By contrast, as you choose public financing, you need to face uncertain persons who are mostly strangers, and these investors surely will estimate whether the prospect earnings deserve the risks before deciding to invest you.
</p>

<p>
The key here is risk control.  
</p>

<p>
As for traditional financings institution such as bank, in order to control risks, they usually require you to use the actual valuables as the collateral. It’s a way with high threshold and you should not only repay capital on time but also need to pay a high interest. It transfers most of the risk to companies, which makes corporate behavior tends to be conservative, and hampers innovation. 
</p>

<p>
To solve this problem, stock market appears, and companies can finance through IPO. This model spread the risk to more individuals, and companies can obtain financing without any debt burden, they can just concentrate on doing the business, the motive to innovation will be well protected. 
</p>

<p>
But IPO still can't solve the problem of high threshold: Start-up enterprises, in the era of knowledge economy, usually need financing at the early stage of the business. But they can rarely reach the standard of Listing Rules, for there is a profit age limit in it. 
</p>

<p>
Thus growth enterprise market （GEM） emerged. GEM reduces the threshold for small businesses and micro-companies to go listing and made special rules for them. But it takes a long term and a high cost so it still can’t meet the needs for most start-up companies on financial flexibility. 
</p>

<p>
Then professional venture capitalists appear. They are willing to take the risks at the early stage of the starting-ups, invest them and hold their shares. If these companies can successfully go listing, they can get huge returns. But generally, these VCs just support those promising start-ups. However, as knowledge economy gets further development, more and more individual entrepreneurs need small fund to get their ideas become a prototype. There is still a lack of financing channels for them.

</p>

<p>
This time comes the angel investors. They generally have financial freedoms and also willing to bear some risks on a small sum to invest the projects they are interested. On one hand they provide the precious seed fund for the start-ups, on the other hand they earn themselves a potential huge rewards by hold the promised shares. 

</p>

<p>
Thus far, the market seems to get a relatively good solution to all the problems for public financing in knowledge economy era. But after carefully analyze the exit way of venture capital and angel investment, we can find the hided systemic risks. 
</p>

<p>
In knowledge economy era, enterprises often have a characteristic: on the initial stage, they require huge amounts of money, but as they grown up and can make profits, they will no longer have any financing needs. For example, some companies, such as Microsoft, Google, Apple, have already earn themselves a huge amount of cash reserves before go public, and stock market for them is just a stock realize channel and trade venues. Its function of financing is useless, which was a deviation from the original intention of establish the stock market.
</p>

<p>
This deviation brings huge potential risks to investors. 
</p>

<p>
We all know that the Matthew effect is very strong in knowledge-based economy, which means that in an industry field, there usually only one leading company that holds almost all the sources. On the formative stage of an industry, there exist many competitor companies and every one is a good investment objective. But in subsequent development, some go better than others. Ideally, affected by the Matthew effect, the superior will survive to win the profits and the inferior will be eliminated.
</p>

<p>
However, if investors regard going public as the only way to exit, they are probably be kidnapped by the projects. Under this circumstance, the inferior competitor enterprises can’t die immediately because the investor will put in more and more money with the hope that it can turn the table, and the superior competitor enterprises can’t live easy but be dragged into low level competitions. As thus, the whole industry will go into a useless internal friction, and the invest risks will go out of control as well. JD.com （it has already went public in NASDAQ） is a typical example, and the vicious competitions between Didi taxi and Kuaidi (they are Chinese version of Uber) is the latest case. 
</p>

<p>
The characteristics of the knowledge economy determined that this problem has no solution. No matter how smart the investors are, as long as he chose to exit by go public, he will eventually come to this dilemma. And beside this way, the prospects of other exit mode is more blurred, the investment will be completely reduced to gambling. 
</p>

<p>
Ultimately, the stock market is tailored for the real economy, and it hasn’t been able to accommodate the knowledge economy. Unless make top design again, minor repairs cannot solve deep-seated problems. 
</p>

<h2 id="New times call for new model">New times call for new model</h2>

<p>
To solve this problem, we must re-examine capitalism from a historical view. 
</p>

<p>
What is capitalism? Simply it means that capital is the king, and can determine the allocation of capital and other resources. But as capitalist developed into a certain stage, the market no longer short of capital, but lack of good investment projects, then the era of knowledge economy comes. There’s a significant difference that good projects will take the ruler position and determines the allocation of other resources, including capital. 
</p>

<p>
This provides a realistic basis for the birth of a new financing model. 
</p>
<p>
We describe this new model like this: Start-ups release their projects directly to the public through an open network platform, use their business plan to persuade the investors and issue stocks in a relatively low price to raise the startup funds. They should also make promises that after reach the business goal by the fund, they will go on issue stocks in a higher price to raise more money for more goals. After several rounds, the enterprise will be finally grown-up and own a big profit like Apple. They no longer need financing and meanwhile they make their stock become blue chips, giving a reward to their investors.
</p>

<p>
Since the initial stock price is very cheap, you could use one U.S. dollar buy one or more stocks, which makes ordinary people can also make a small investment (e.g. $ 100), to support a dream and a worthwhile project. Even if the investment fails, it won’t bring any risks to their financial situation; but if the investment is successful, the investor can not only help the start-ups, but also win themselves great rewards. This will be a very cost-effective deal. 
</p>

<p>
Moreover, like the traditional listed stocks, the shares issued in this way could also be traded through real-time self-built trading platforms, which makes the early investors can exit easily when needed. 
</p>

<p>
Suppose that in the first round, the investors purchase the stock at a price of $ 1 per share and the market forecast shows that this company will issue additional shares in the second round of financing at a price of $ 5 per share. So the first round investors will get a profit at $ 4 per share, which means that they can exit easily by selling the stock at a price below $ 5 per share.
</p>

<p>
Even the previous round investor may sell the stock at the same price as the official, new investors will still prefer to buy stocks from investors because it won’t increase the total amount of the stocks. Previous investor will always have the chance to exit.
</p>

<h2 id="Tripartite game to ensure fair ">Tripartite game to ensure fair </h2>

<p>
we may have noticed such a problem: When the enterprise issues the additional shares, the new investor will always prefer to buy stocks from previous investors, and then will the company’s financing purpose be in vain? In addition, how to price the stock before the start-ups can make profits? 
</p>
<p>
Right, it is the advantage of the new model that it will always ensure the exit priority of the previous investor, followed by the financing right of the companies. 
</p>
<p>
If the start-ups want to continue a series of financing, they must have a promising future and make a reasonable stock price. There is a tripartite game: Enterprise, pre investors and new investors. With a good prospection, pre investors want the price of the additional shares could be higher which means that the value of the stocks on hand is higher, while new investors expect a lower price to reduce their purchase cost. It is a zero-sum game for them. However, because the start-ups may not have made any profits and the earnings per share aren’t clear, it’s hard to reach an agreement on the price. The enterprise, as the third player, joins the game. It will give a reasonable share price while take the other two players’ reaction in to consideration. Under this price, pre investors will prefer to keep their stocks and new investors will want to buy in. The financing succeed and also step further.
</p>
<p>
Tripartite game perfectly solves the problem that how to estimate the stock price before the company get earnings, without losing fairness. 
</p>
<p>
It is always a zero-sum game in traditional public financing model: what you get is what I lost. In order to ensure a fair trade, it requires higher supervision to achieve an information symmetry, which makes threshold generated. 
</p>
<p>
Through the hand of the market, new model solved this problem skillfully. The three players can maximize their own interests in the process of promoting the development of the enterprise. Without excessive external supervision, we can achieve fair deal. 
</p>
<p>
Otherwise, new mode also solves the valuing problem for start-ups. For a good project, there’s always a big gap between its potential value and current value. In other financial mode, if calculate share price according to current value, the entrepreneur will suffer losses; if calculate share price according to potential value, the investors will face huge risks. New mode avoids this problem perfectly through issue shares of different prices according to different stages.
</p>
<p>
As for how to make a price at the first round of financing, it should depend on whether the project has an optimistic prospection; the possibility for realize it; the current rate of progress and many other composite factors. You have the right to make any price, but investors have the right to decide whether to participate and invest a start-up capital to your project. 
</p>

<p>
The world has entered the era of knowledge economy, a lot of new projects need financing at their initial phase, but they are unable to prove their worth at the stage. Although angel investors and venture capitalists give a solution to the problem in some degree, the inner contradictions between new economy model and traditional financing model are always existed, and already start to hinder the further development of the knowledge economy.

</p>
<p>
In fact, this new model has already begun to emerge, such as the popular creativity financing platform：KickStarter（<a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/">http://www.kickstarter.com/</a>）. On this kind of platforms, anyone can describe ideas they want to complete and the minimum amount of financing. If others like the project, they can give money to it. These platforms have already helped hundreds of thousands projects raise more than one hundred million U.S. dollars. 
</p>
<p>
Such sites can actually be more popular, as long as they are able to answer the question more clearly: Why donors are willing to put money in these projects for nothing? 
</p>
<p>
It is more like a kind of charity or for buying some goods they are interested for now, but if we give it a commercial driving force, that is, with the premise that the investor like the project and meanwhile can get its stock to share the future profits, I believe investors will be more willing to participate in the proposer's dream and help realize the project, and the network platforms like  Indiegogo will be more popular. It is the new financing model that we discussed in this article. 
</p>
<p>
The new financing model is not only more flexible, convenient, and efficient, but also requires a very high quality to the projects, which will significantly accelerate the survival of the fittest. For enterprises, the only way to keep a virtuous circle is to make concrete progress otherwise the financing will more likely to fail. This characteristic reduces the risk for investors from being kidnapped. 
</p>
<p>
You can’t say JD.com is failed although it has been in the red. With its current size, it still has the strength to be the number one and the final winner, but the investors may have already run out of money before it can gain profits. As everyone puts in huge capital investment, there will be no significant weaknesses and certainty of winning. If it slack off a little in the competition with other E-commercial companies, JD.com will be likely rapidly decline.
</p>
<p>
There will be another situation if JD.com uses the new financing model: its customers can invest small amount of money and become shareholders. After becoming shareholders, they will be more willing to buy goods in JD.com, which helps JD goes into a virtuous circle. Under the influence of Matthew effect, the E-commercial market’s differentiation accelerated, making JD win easily. Meanwhile JD’s early investors don’t need to put in more and more capital in the hope of being listed and the profits is guaranteed while the risk is significantly reduced. 
</p>
<p>
We know that for a lot of new economic projects, once they have grown up, there will be a natural monopoly. It is a problem that can’t be solved in the traditional mode. You cannot divide Google’s customers into two parts just like split a company of the real economy. But new model gives an ingenious solution to this problem: its openness gives everyone the chance to become a shareholder and share its monopoly profits, thereby solved the fair distribution problem that comes with monopoly at its source. 
</p>
<p>
In short, the new model is an inevitable outcome as the economy develops. It changes the current centralized securities market into many platform stock markets. It will surely challenge the current interest pattern and has a high requirement in law and market environment. Only in the nations of laws could it carries forward.
