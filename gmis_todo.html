<p>short-term goals（2014.6-2015.12）：</p>
	<p>• Developing codes to reach the industrial grade application standard</p>
	<p>In order to proof theory more quickly, the quality of prototype code is not sturdy and durable enough for industrial grade use and we need time to improve it.</p>
	
	<p>• Improve the compatibility to natural language</p>
	<p>As you can see in the demonstrated video, although we can input natural language in GMIS, it is still hard in usage comparing with daily dialog. There’s a large space for it to improve. For example when we input integer or character string, we need to use a whole predicate phrase, which in fact can be replaced by inputting integer or character string directly.</p>
	<p>• Realize cross-platform, especially mobile platform</p>
	<p>Theoretically, GMIS can be used in any hardware platforms and all hardware platform based on GMIS will be robotized. But at present, our prototype can just run in window platform and we need more work for it to cover other hardware platform, especial mobile platforms, which will increase the application value of GMIS enormously.</p>
	<p>• Transform cell phone into super computer</p>
	<p>We will do another demonstration of hardware controlling on the base of above works. This time we may show you: GMIS can transform whatever cell phones, PC and open-source hardware like Raspberry Pi into robots and they will be able to cooperate logically and computes together like a super computer.</p>
